1. Procedural Programming is the type of programming that makes procedures such as calculating data, while 
Object-Oriented Programming is the type of programming that customizes attributes about certain objects 
defined in the program.
Procedural is the brains while Object-Oriented is the looks. Let's use baking a cake as an example.
The procedural part is where we follow a recipe, measuring ingredients, the mixing, and baking time.
The object-oriented part is when we put on the frosting and other decorative elements to the cake.

2. GUI means Graphical User Interface. It helps with making programs and applications by creating and 
displaying interactive objects for the user. It helps with geomatics applications because for example, 
if we need to look at maps and pinpoint locations on that map, we would be able to with the help of GUI.
We can also input data into the apps with the help of GUI and it can display the analyzed data once it was
computed.

3. Operation Overloading in Object-Oriented Programming allows the user to repeatedly use a function and 
also modify it when needed. Programming when attributes are invloved can get redundant but overloading 
allows the user to reuse these functions without overriding the system.

4. Inheritance allows the user to give attributes or components from a previous class for another class.
A parent class with an attribute X can be inherited by a child class in the same program.
For example, if parent class has a "power" of 5, then the child class inherits that "power" of 5.

5. The front-end is the one that presents the information to the user. 
The back-end is the one that organizes and analyzes the data before handing it over to the front-end.
The database is the one that stores all the data for safe keeping.
We could use delivery couriers for example. 
The front-end would be the delivery person that brings you your parcel. 
The back-end would be the management that organizes the many parcels to be delivered to different locations.
The database would be the warehouses or hubs where the parcels are stored before going out for delivery.
