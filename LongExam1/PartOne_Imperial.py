1.  Procedural Programming is programming that results in only one outcome while Functional Programming
    is programming that may have several outcomes because it deals with the if and else functions.
    Think of procedural programming like a straight road where there is only one destination while
    functional programming is like a maze with different turns and escape paths. Turning right will lead
    you on a different path than if you tunred left and so on until you find the way out. 

2.  Git is a helpful tool for programming because it is a site where programming files can be shared,
    saved, and edited with the people you are collaborating with. It also helps with being updated on the
    latest version of the programming file that was edited.
    For example, if I want to make a programming file with someone who doesn't live anywhere near me so
    we can't just physically meet on a whim to work on the project together, we can use Git to share the
    same file and work on it on different times but still be updated on what the other one is doing or has
    revised on the project.

3.  The while loop is used for the if and else functions. The for loop is used to get the result when the
    if and else condition is not used. In geomatics we can use these loops for getting the bearings of the
    lines of a traverse from their given distance and azimuth from the south. We use the while loop for
    determining the direction of the bearings and also for converting the degrees to DMS format. We use
    the for loop to organize the values from the while loop to a table. 

4.  The divide and conquer paraadigm is used for big projects when there is a lot of programming needed.
    Dividing the big problem into smaller problems and finding solutuions for those smaller problems
    will help us solve the big problem.
    For example, when we have to do our monthly deep clean of the house it is a bit daunting to think of
    the cleaning the entire house as a whole but if you do the cleaning by each room or section of the
    house, it is much easier to put a plan in motion what to do first. So little by little, room by room,
    the entire house gets cleaner.

5.  A geomatics task that can be optimized using programming is looking for the dip and strike of three
    boreholes.There is a lot of computing that must be done to get the results we need so it would be much
    easier if we can just input all the values into a program and let it do the job more efficiently,
    specially if we are dealing with very big measurements.
    First, we input the given elevation and depth of the holes, their bearings, and t
